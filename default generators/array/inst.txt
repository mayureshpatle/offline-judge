===========================================================================

DETAILS FOR ENTERING ABOVE VALUES:

Line 1: Min_Len & Max_Len 
- These denote Minimum and Maximum lengths respectively for the array(s) to generate
- If array elements can have at most 10 digits, these values should be in range 1 to 10^6
- If array elements have more than 10 digits, these values should be between 1 to 2*10^5
- Max_Len should be greater than or equal to Min_Len
- Arrays with larger constraints may not be processable on normal computers
- Min_Len will be automatically set to 1 if any of the above constraints is violated
- Max_Len will be automatically set to 2*10^5 in case of violation

Line 2: Min_Val & Max_Val
- Minimum and maximum values that array elements can have
- Min_Val can be between –9*10^18 and 9*10^18
- Max_Val can be between Min_Val and 9*10^18
- For larger numbers, please use string generator with digits
- Max_Val should be greater than or equal to Min_Val, else Max_Val will be set to Min_Val
- In case of other errors, Min_Val will be set to 1 and Max_Val will be set to Max_Len

Line 3: Order_of_Elements
- 0 for random order
- 1 for increasing order
- 2 for decreasing order
- Any other value will result in random order

Line 4: Distinct_Flag
- 1 if all elements of array(s) should be distinct 
- 0 if duplicate elements are allowed
- Any other value may result in duplicate elements
- If this flag is set then make sure you’ve given appropriate ranges for array length & value
- Any violation caused because of this constraint may lead to decrement in array length

Line 5: Permutaiton_Flag
- 1 if you want array to be any permutation of [1,N], where N is the length of array
- 0 if no such expectation
- In case of any other values, this falg will be set to 0
- In case of any violation, Length and Value constraints will be changed accordingly

Line 6: Delimiter
- Leave this line blank if array elements need to be separated by space 
- Write “ENTER” (without quotes) to use ‘\n’ as delimiter
- Write “TAB” (without quotes) to use ‘\t’ as delimiter
- Enter any character (or string) that you want to use as delimiter between array elements

Line 7: Mutiple_Testcases_Flag
- 1 if multiple testcases are allowed per file (No. of testcases will be printed in file)
- 0 if file contains only one array (1 will not be printed in the file)
- Any other values will be considered as 0

Line 8: Max_T
- This line is required only if Mutiple_Testcases_Flag is 1, otherwise leave this line blank
- This Value denotes the maximum number of testcases per file
- You can also leave this line blank to set this value automatically
- Generated testcases will be within the limits of processing capacity of normal computers


===========================================================================
Created file is valid if last line of Status is TEST FILE CREATED SUCCESSFULLY!
===========================================================================
GENERATION FORMAT:

If Multiple_Testcases_Flag is NOT SET:
First line will contain length of array
Next line(s) will contain the array elements separated by chosen delimiter

If Multiple_Testcases_Flag is SET:
First line will contain an integer T, denoting total number of testcases in file
Each array is then described in 2 lines (or more if ‘\n’ delimiter is used)
- First line will contain the length of array
- Next line(s) will contain the array elements separated by the chosen delimiter
